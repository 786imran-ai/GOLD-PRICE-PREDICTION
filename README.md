# GOLD-PRICE-PREDICTION
This repository hosts a machine learning project dedicated to forecasting the price of a target asset using intermarket data. We employ a Random Forest Regressor to model the non-linear relationships between major financial instruments, including global indices and commodity ETFs, to generate highly accurate price predictions.
