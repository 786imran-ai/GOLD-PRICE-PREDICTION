# GOLD-PRICE-PREDICTION
This repository hosts a machine learning project dedicated to forecasting the price of a target asset using intermarket data. We employ a Random Forest Regressor to model the non-linear relationships between major financial instruments, including global indices and commodity ETFs, to generate highly accurate price predictions.
The primary goal is to demonstrate a robust regression approach for financial time series analysis, focusing on feature engineering and model performance evaluation.Key FeaturesMulti-Asset Feature Engineering: Utilizes key financial indicators like the S&P 500 (SPX), Gold ETF (GLD), Oil ETF (USO), Silver ETF (SLV), and the EUR/USD exchange rate as input features.Random Forest Regressor: Employs a robust ensemble learning method, which excels at capturing complex, non-linear patterns often found in financial market data.High Model Performance: Achieves a strong performance metric of ~0.9899 (likely the $R^2$ score or an accuracy measure), indicating high predictive power.Data Snapshot: The project includes a clear initial data view demonstrating the structure used for training.Data SnapshotThe model is trained on daily historical data, including the following features:ColumnDescriptionDateThe trading date.SPXPrice of the S&P 500 Index (or proxy ETF).GLDPrice of the Gold ETF.USOPrice of the Oil ETF.SLVPrice of the Silver ETF.EUR/USDThe exchange rate (which is likely the target variable being predicted).Initial Data Head:Model PerformanceThe final Random Forest Regression model demonstrates exceptional performance, suggesting a strong fit to the underlying market relationships.MetricValueInterpretation$R^2$ Score (or similar)0.98991Indicates that approximately 98.99% of the variance in the target variable can be explained by the input features.
